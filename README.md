# MICROMOUSE
 Micromouse is a small autonomous robot capable of navigating a maze to find the shortest path from the starting position to the goal. 
 - Firstly, we had to investigate and assess various maze scanning algorithms. These algorithms help navigate and find way out of the maze.These algorithms can be used to **analyze** the structure of a maze and answer questions about it.There are different algorithms suited for different scenarios.

   ## MAZE SCANNING ALGORITHMS
   ### 1. Wall Following
   The wall following algorithm is based on simple logic of movement through the maze by either following the left hand side or the right hand side of the enclosure wall. In simple words, If the maze is simply connected(a perfect maze), then by keeping one hand in contact with one wall of the maze the solver is guaranteed not to get lost and will reach the goal.
   <br>
  ### **ADVANTAGES**
   - This algorithm has simple logic and is easy to understand and implement.
   - Requires minimal coding and simple sensor data.
   - Garunteed to solve and find the goal in *Perfect Mazes*.

  ### **DISADVANTAGES**
 
<br>

   - IF the maze is *not simply connected*, like it has loops, dead ends or multiple solutions, the the mouse is likely to get stuck or move endlessly on loops.
   - Does not guarantee *shortest path* from start to finish.
   - It does not create *map* of the maze while it navigates. It simply reacts to immidiate responses from the sensors and navigates.

   This is the video depicting the problem faced while using a wall following algorithm:[right_wall_follower](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1flYjwpWsy6WhyAmOay1xKx8tjAGSHOHe/view?usp=sharing)
   <br>
   The mouse simply loops back to the start as the maze is not simply connected.
<br>
[In this case](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1BO-K_sEmUj3vDzHHRxPZWSjLFI5veKmK/view?usp=sharing) the wall following algorithm worked.

### 2. Mix of wall follower algorithm and tremaux algorithm
Tremaux algorithm keeps a track of each path that it travels through so that it does not get stuck into a particular loop , it gives more priority to the path which is less traveled . 
<br>
### **ADVANTAGES**
- It does not get stuck in an infinite loop.
- It can be used for a variety of mazes.

### **DISADVANTAGES**
- It requires much more space than a wall follower algorithm since it keeps track of all paths which and  how many times they are taken.

### 3. Floodfill Algorithm

<br>
Flood Fill is popular algorithm used in Micromouse competitions to determine the shortest path through a maze. It works by simulating the filling of a maze with water from the goal point.
The maze is represented as a 2D grid, with each cell containing information about walls and distance to the goal.The water flow starts at the goal, so algorithm assigns value of 0 to the goal. Next, iteratively, it gives neighboring accessible cells progressively greater distance values. Until each reachable cell has a distance value assigned to it, this procedure keeps going.Once the entire maze is filled with distance values, the shortest path from the start to the goal can be determined by following the cells with decreasing distance values. Whenever the mouse identifies any wall in it's path, it makes a layout of the maze and runs floodfill again to assign new distance values to each cell as per the maze layout and it continues until we reach the goal.

<br>
This video shows how a floodfill algorithm works:(https://drive.google.com/file/d/1i9GHAzxoJ6IoAXuxypmXep02S_17EAth/view?usp=sharing)
<br>
<br>
Since we found floodfill to be most efficient among others, we choose to continue with floodfill algorithm.
<br>
<br>
After the initial exploration of the maze, once complete layout of the maze is known, the algorithm finds the shortest route by applying floodfill over the maze having data of all wall.

### **ADVANTAGES**

- This algorithm guarantees the shortest path from start to goal and is relatively fast.

### **DISADVANTAGES**
- The algorithm requires complete layout of the maze before it can find shortest path from start to goal.
- Computationally costly for lagre mazes.

  ## Overview of the code

  The floodfill and path finding code outlines a flood fill algorithm for navigating a maze, specifically for a micromouse robot. The API class simulates the micromouse interface functions, while the floodfill function uses the flood fill algorithm to navigate through the maze.

Here's an overview of the key components and functionality:

1. *API Class*: This class simulates interactions with the maze environment, including movement, turning, wall detection, and setting visual elements (like walls, colors, and text) on the maze.

2. *Direction Handling*:
   - turnRight and turnLeft update the current direction after a right or left turn, respectively.
   - updateCoordinates adjusts the robot's coordinates based on its current direction.
   - update combines turning and coordinate updating based on a given left/right indicator.

3. *Flood Fill Algorithm*:
   - *Initialization*: Initializes various arrays to track visited cells, wall information, and maze distances.
   - *Wall Detection and Updating*: Uses the API functions to detect walls and updates the internal wall representation accordingly.
   - *Flood Fill Logic*: Uses a queue to perform a breadth-first search (BFS) to calculate distances from the target cells (center of the maze).
   - *Movement Logic*: Decides the robot's next move based on the calculated distances and current direction, aiming to minimize the distance to the target cells.

4. *Main Loop*:
   - The main loop continues until the robot reaches one of the center cells.
   - After reaching the center, the robot turns around and continues exploring until all cells are visited, ensuring the entire maze is mapped.

### Example Execution Flow

1. *Start*: The robot starts at the initial position (0,0) facing west.
2. *Flood Fill*: The algorithm calculates the distance to the nearest center cell for each cell in the maze.
3. *Movement*: The robot moves based on the calculated distances and updates its direction and coordinates accordingly.
4. *Wall Handling*: The robot detects walls and updates the internal representation of the maze.
5. *Color and Text Setting*: The robot sets colors and texts on the maze cells for visualization purposes.
